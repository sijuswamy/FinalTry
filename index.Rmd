This book is designed as a free online resourse to the second semester B.Tech students in APJ Abdul Kalam University, Kerala. In this book, we will explain topics of Differential equations and Integral transforms. This resourse will help you like a faculty. In each section link to video lessons is embedded. This link will lead you to the YouTube video lesson that explain the present topic in a lucid style in your teacher's voice.
